To perform the time series prediction, initialize a KernelTreePredictor,
call its 'fit' method on a training set of tree time series and then call
predict on new time series.

The predictor does not only predict in kernel space but also performs a mapping
back to the space of trees via the scheme proposed in

class KernelTreePredictor(BaseEstimator):
    """ A time series predictor for time series of trees based on the edit
    distance and a radial basis function kernel and maps the prediction from
    kernel space back to the space of trees based on an edit distance trick.

    In particular, let x_1^k, ..., x_{T_j}^k be the kth time series in the
    training data. First, we re-order these time series to tuples
    (x_t^j, x_{t+1}^j) = (x_i, y_i).
    Let \{(x_i, y_j)\} now be the overall set of these tuples.

    Second, we compute all pairwise tree edit distances d(x_i, x_j).

    Third, we transform these into a similarity matrix K with entries

    .. math:: K_{i, j} = exp[-d(x_i, x_j)/(2 * \\psi ** 2)]

    where self.psi is the bandwidth parameter of the radial basis function
    kernel.

    Note that this matrix may be indefinite because the tree edit distance
    is generally not Euclidean. In other words, K may not be a kernel.
    However, the remaining scheme will still work even with slightly negative
    eigenvalues.

    Finally, we add the noise variance to the diagonal and invert the matrix.

    .. math:: \\tilde K = (K + \\sigma^2 \cdot I)^{-1}

    We store K tilde as self._Kinv.

    When we wish to predict, we first compute the edit distances of current
    tree x to all training trees d(x, x_i).

    Second, we transform these into a kernel vector k with entries

    .. math:: k_i = exp[-d(x, x_i)/(2 * self.sigma ** 2)]

    Third, we apply the predictive formula

    .. math:: \\alpha = \\tilde K \cdot \vec k

    The coefficients alpha define a linear combination of change vectors in
    the kernel space. In particular, we can write our prediction in the kernel
    space as

    .. math:: \\vec y = \\phi(x) + \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\cdot [\\phi(y_i) - \\phi(x_i)]

    where phi is the mapping into the kernel space.

    If we now wish to infer the tree in primal space, this problem can be
    re-written as follows.

    .. math:: \\min_y \\quad ||\\vec y - \\phi(y)||^2

    In other words, we are looking for the tree that is as close as possible to
    our predicted vector in kernel space. Assuming that the Euclidean distance
    in kernel space is approximatively equivalent to the tree edit distance, we
    can re-write this problem as

    .. math:: \\min_y \\quad d(x, y)^2 + \\sum_i \\alpha_i [d(y_i, y)^2 - d(y_i, y)^2]

    where d is the tree edit distance. We can apply a greedy scheme for this
    optimization problem by applying edits toward y_i where alpha_i is largest
    until the loss does not decrease anymore, then applying edits toward y_i
    where alpha_i is second-largest until the loss does not decrease anymore,
    and so on until there are no coefficients left.
