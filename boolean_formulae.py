Generates data for the 'boolean formulae' data set, where we start with a
random Boolean formula and then apply all of the following simplification
rules until none applies anymore:

1. and(x, False) is equivalent to False.
2. and(x, True) is equivalent to x.
3. or(x, True) is equivalent to True.
4. or(x, False) is equivalent to x.
5. and(x, x) is equivalent to x.
6. or(x, x) is equivalent to x.
7. and(x, not_x) is equivalent to False.
8. or(x, not_x) is equivalent to True.
